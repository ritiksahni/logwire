## logwire

`logwire` is a Node.js script that takes a filename and makes it accessible over a web dashboard. This is useful when a developer wants to host a log file that keeps changing online and share it in a network.

### Usage

```
npm install -g logwire
logwire watch <filename> <port>
```

A web dashboard will be made accessible over localhost with real-time log data that can be shared with other developers, stakeholders.
